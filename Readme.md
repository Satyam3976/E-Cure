## E-Cure

### Problem Statement
Doctors are generally avoiding nowadays to take in appointments of patients and patients are not willing to move out if they are ill in view of COVID-19. So we have implemented a Web Based solution through which patients can fix an online appointment with the Doctor when it is not necassery to meet in-person.

#### Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

Step 1 : Clone the repository

Step 2 : Open a terminal.Change directory to E-Cure/server and install node_modules

         cd E-Cure/server

Step 3 : Open a new terminal and change directory to E-Cure/client and install node_modules

          cd E-Cure/client 
	 
	      npm install



Step 4 : You will need to run Backend & Frontend seperately!

	    In the first terminal where directory is E-Cure/server run the command npm start 
	 
	    In the second terminal where directory is E-Cure/client run the command npm start
